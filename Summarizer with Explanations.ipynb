    "We perform extractive text summarization using the TextRank algorithm which uses a graph-based ranking model which requires no training, using GloVe v1.2 pre-trained word vectors, and performing various natural language preprocessing using NLTK library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph based ranking algorithms allow knowledge about the text as a whole and the relationship between different parts of a text to be used in making specific local ranking decisions.  It does so by taking into account global information recursively computed from the entire graph in order to evaluate the importance of a vertex within a graph, rather than relying only on local information.\n",

    "Traditional word vector techniques depend on the distance or angle between pairs of word vectors to determine strength of a set  word representations.  Glove attempts to uncover more of the language structure by examining not only the scalar difference but various dimensions of difference.  It does this by examining the ratio of the co-occurance probability between pairings rather the just the probabilties themselves.  A weighted least squares regression is then applied to remove the noise.  Dimesionality reduction is applied to the co-occurance matrix to yield a lower dimensional matrix such that each vector represents a word."
