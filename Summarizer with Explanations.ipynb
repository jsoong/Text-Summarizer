    "We perform extractive text summarization using the TextRank algorithm which uses a graph-based ranking model which requires no training, using GloVe v1.2 pre-trained word vectors, and performing various natural language preprocessing & tokenization using NLTK library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph based ranking algorithms allow knowledge about the text as a whole and the relationship between different parts of a text to be used in making specific local ranking decisions.  It does so by taking into account global information recursively computed from the entire graph to evaluate the importance of a vertex within a graph, rather than relying only on local information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional word vector techniques depend on the distance or angle between pairs of word vectors to determine the strength of a set of word representations.  Glove attempts to uncover more of the language structure by examining not only the scalar difference but various dimensions of difference.  It does this by examining the ratio of the co-occurrence probability between pairings rather than just the probabilities alone.  A weighted least squares regression is then applied to remove the noise.  Dimensionality reduction is applied to the co-occurrence matrix to yield a lower dimensional matrix such that each vector represents a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commonly, the ROUGE Metric is used to evaluate summarizer performance, but we did not have immediate resources to test it.  Subjectively, the performance seems reasonably good.  When summarizing NY Times articles, they were significantly shorter (33% of original article length was chosen), were easy to read, and conveyed the most important ideas within the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "This summarizer does not understand or recognize the grammatical structure of language so it cannot extract this type of semantic information and its importance in relating sentences; eg: pronoun references.  Abstractive text summarization, possibly with GANs would be an interesting future project."
